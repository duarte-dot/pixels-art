# Pixels Art

One of my first front-end projects. It consists of a 5x5 pixel canvas where you can paint using a color palette with the functionality to generate random colors. The colors and your artwork will be saved in Local Storage so they will persist even after refreshing the page.

To view the project, clone the repository and open index.html using the Live Server extension in VSCode.
